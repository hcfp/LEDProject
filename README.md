# LEDProject
A compilation of code that can be uploaded to an Arduino to create effects on a strip of LED lights (WS2812B LEDs specifically). Some effects are adapted from https://github.com/atuline/FastLED-SoundReactive

The FFT and FHT effects use Fast Fourier Transforms and Fast Hartley Transforms to change the effect based on the frequency of audio picked up by a sound detector chip.
